## External Domain Warning for N1
=======WORK IN PROGRESS==========

This is an extension to visually warn you that a given thread contains participants from external domains.

Note: This version may be broken / unusable due to ongoing development. I will be introducing a stable branch in the near future.

Limitations:
- Does not update when thread is updated.
- Does not yet show warning when composing new messages to external domains (and when these draft recipients are altered).
  - Need to handle reply to an existing thread.
  - Need to handle composition of entirely new message.
